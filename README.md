motion-reveal-plugin
====================

As a test for the Leap Motion controller SDK (https://www.leapmotion.com/), we've created a plugin for Reveal.js which enables you to control your presentation with gestures.

Usage
=====

The plugin uses the swipe gestures to navigate to the next or previous slide.
Pressing 'g' locks and unlocks navigation with gestures.

How to install
==============

1. Install the Reveal.js library. (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
2. add the plugin script to the existing js folder.
3. add the plugin script to the end of your index.html file.
